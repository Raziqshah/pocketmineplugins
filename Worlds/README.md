## Description
Because there is no plugin to manage all aspects of the game for each world like WorldGuard on Bukkit, I made Worlds.
With Worlds, you can control events like breaking blocks, dropping items, and many more.

If you want to help or you have ideas to make my plugin better, feel free to make a commit or open an issue.
Please report bugs on the issues page.

## Features
- Create and remove worlds
- Copy and rename worlds
- Load and unload worlds
- Teleport to worlds
- Control nearly every event for each world (it's getting more and more).
    - World's gamemode
    - Block breaking and placing
    - PVP
    - Damage (everything like attacking, fall damage, ...)
    - Explosion
    - Item drop
    - Hunger
    - Fly
    - You have an idea what to add? Feel free to open an issue.
- Easy to use, fast and mostly bug-free.

## How to use
Worlds is really easy to use. Here is the command syntax:

`/worlds <info|list>`

`/worlds <create|delete|load|unload|tp> <world> [type]`

`/worlds <copy|rename> <from> <to>`

`/worlds set gamemode <survival|creative|adventure|spectator>`

`/worlds set <build|pvp|damage|drop|hunger|fly> <true|false>`

And for beginners, here are some examples of commands:

List all worlds on the server: `/worlds list`

Teleport to world lobby: `/worlds tp lobby`

Generate a flat world named newworld: `/worlds create newworld flat`

No dropping in survival world: Go to survival world an run `/worlds set drop false`

Gamemode 1 in creative world: Go to creative world an run `/worlds set gamemode 1`
