# Pocketmine plugins
A collection of Minecraft PMMP plugins branched to the pocketmine versions I'm able to use on www.server.pro

Started with a small set of plugins and building up, 
see the https://github.com/genboy/pocketmineplugins/issues

[PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues), [Worlds](https://github.com/survanetwork/Worlds/issues), [BigBrother](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother/issues), [Iprotector](https://github.com/DerddyDert/iProtector-v4.0/network), [EssentialsPE](https://github.com/LegendOfMCPE/EssentialsPE), [ClientConsole](https://github.com/dktapps/ClientConsole)
 
If you have a plugin folder for testing with other versions I welcome you to add your PMMP version branch plugin collection for testing & sharing ideas.
