# Minecraft Pocketmine Plugins Collection

A collection of Minecraft Pocketmine PM plugins, tested with the latest version available on my server.pro hosting account.

Started with a small set of plugins and building up.  

[PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues), [Worlds](https://github.com/survanetwork/Worlds/issues), [BigBrother](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother/issues), [Iprotector](https://github.com/DerddyDert/iProtector-v4.0/network), [EssentialsPE](https://github.com/LegendOfMCPE/EssentialsPE)

A consistent warning for JAVA EDITION PLAYERS, NO CRAFTING unfortunately, the BigBrother Plugin team is working on it. 
BUT seriously HOW COOL IS IT WITH THAT JAVA EDITION 1.12.2 INSIDE POCKETMINE (awesome [BigBrotherTeam](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother)!)

Many thanks to all the devs for making Minecraft Pocketmine better!
