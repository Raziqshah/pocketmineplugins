# Minecraft Pocketmine Plugins Collection

A collection of Minecraft Pocketmine PM plugins, tested with the latest version available on my server.pro hosting account.

Started with a small set of plugins and building up.  

[PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues), [Worlds](https://github.com/survanetwork/Worlds/issues), [BigBrother](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother/issues), [Iprotector](https://github.com/DerddyDert/iProtector-v4.0/network), [EssentialsPE](https://github.com/LegendOfMCPE/EssentialsPE), [ClientConsole](https://github.com/dktapps/ClientConsole)

[BigBrother](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother): AWESOME! CONNECT WITH JAVA EDITION 1.12.2 ON POCKETMINE SERVER
A consistent warning for JAVA EDITION PLAYERS, NO CRAFTING possible unfortunately, the BigBrother Plugin team is working on it. 
[PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues): GREAT WORK! MOBS INTERACT(a bit) AND ATTACK.
Hope we will be able to feed, befriend and use animals in the future. 

## All the best to all the Pocketmine PM and PMMP Plugin devs
Pocketmine makes Minecraft Alive and Open again as it should be!


What's up?
[95CivicSi](https://github.com/95CivicSi) shines some light on an important question [issue](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues/246#issuecomment-340419465)

'If by "animal riding function" you mean the ability to use a saddle and/or ride certain mobs (such as horses, llamas, pigs etc..) then these features are work in progress with no ETA as some of the necessary components are not available in PMMP yet.

As for boats and minecarts, neither of these are properly implemented in PMMP yet. This plugin targets MobAI and items directly related to Mob movements and interactions. PureEntitiesX will not implement minecarts and boats, and interaction with them will not be supported until they are fully functional in the PMMP.'
