- [x] = original code package for latest stable ALPHA 12 (either .phar or .zip)
- [ ] = plugin is not fully updated, at least version bumped untill ALPHA 12 source update is released

! Removed: Realtime plugin by [Point808](https://github.com/Point808/PMMP_Plugins/tree/master/RealTime/) - why? nice idea and it works but you see the sun/moon/shadow jumping back wich makes it look very hacky

See [issues](https://github.com/genboy/pocketmineplugins/issues) for bit more info
