# Minecraft Pocketmine Plugins Collection

A collection of Minecraft Pocketmine PM plugins, tested with the latest version available on my server.pro hosting account.

Started with a small set of plugins and building up.  

[PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues), [Worlds](https://github.com/survanetwork/Worlds/issues), [BigBrother](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother/issues), [Iprotector](https://github.com/DerddyDert/iProtector-v4.0/network), [EssentialsPE](https://github.com/LegendOfMCPE/EssentialsPE), [ClientConsole](https://github.com/dktapps/ClientConsole)

Server
This collection runs with PocketMine-MP_1.7dev-326_bd2cb858_API-3.0.0-ALPHA9.phar 
(most of the plugins will probably still work with ALPHA8 releases)

Mobs & Animals
[PureEntitiesX](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/issues): GREAT WORK! MOBS INTERACT(a bit) AND ATTACK.
Hope we will be able to feed, befriend and use animals in the future. 

Java Edition
[BigBrother](https://github.com/BigBrotherTeam/BigBrother): AWESOME! CONNECT WITH JAVA EDITION 1.12.2 ON POCKETMINE SERVER
A consistent warning for JAVA EDITION PLAYERS, NO CRAFTING possible unfortunately, the BigBrother Plugin team is working on it. 


## All the best to all the Pocketmine PM and PMMP Plugin devs
Pocketmine makes Minecraft Alive and Open again as it should be!
