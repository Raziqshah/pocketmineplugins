# Pocketmine plugins
A collection of Minecraft PMMP plugins branched to the pocketmine versions I'm able to use on www.server.pro

Just started this repository, see the https://github.com/genboy/pocketmineplugins/issues

If you have a plugin folder for testing with other versions I welcome you to add your PMMP version branch plugin collection.
